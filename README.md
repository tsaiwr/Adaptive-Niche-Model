# Adaptive-Niche-Model
The codes presented here are the minimal core for simulating the adaptive niche model of mutualistic networks. They are written for Matlab.
The Matlab library "BiMat" is used for analyzing the network structures, which is publicly available via the link: https://bimat.github.io/.
